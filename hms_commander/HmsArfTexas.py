HmsArfTexas - Texas 1-day areal-reduction factor (Asquith, 1999)

Implements the areal-reduction factor (ARF) equations published in Table 7 of

    Asquith, W.H., 1999, Areal-Reduction Factors for the Precipitation of the
    1-Day Design Storm in Texas: U.S. Geological Survey Water-Resources
    Investigations Report 99-4267, 81 p.

The same equations are reproduced as Table 4-12 of the TxDOT Hydraulic Design
Manual (Ch. 4, Sec. 13, 09/2019).

Scope. Duration and recurrence interval are hard limits that ``extrapolate``
never relaxes; only the radius/area domain can be extrapolated:

- 1-day (24 hr) design storm only (the method rests on daily precipitation
  data; WRIR 99-4267 p. 25 limits it to the one-day duration). Any other
  duration raises ``ValueError``, even with ``extrapolate=True``.
- Three study areas only: Austin, Dallas, Houston.
- Circular-watershed radius 0 to 50 mi (area 0 to ~7,850 mi2); non-circular
  watersheds use the report's cell method (distance of each cell to the
  watershed centroid, 0 to 50 mi). Beyond 50 mi raises ``ValueError`` unless
  ``extrapolate=True`` (warning logged; last published segment continued).
- Recurrence interval of 2 years or greater (smaller values raise
  ``ValueError``, even with ``extrapolate=True``). The published relation is the
  "2-year or greater" depth-distance relation and is not a function of the
  recurrence interval within that range; the report notes that the true ARF
  does vary with recurrence interval, which this relation does not capture.

HDM caution (Sec. 13, p. 4-64): "the applicability of this method diminishes
the farther away from the Austin, Dallas, or Houston areas the study area is
and as the duration of the design storm increasingly differs from that of
1 day." The report (p. 25) says the same. Use for a watershed far from these
cities, for other durations, or for rainfall events shorter than a day is an
engineering judgement that this module does not validate.

All methods are static - no instantiation required.

    Texas 1-day areal-reduction factors per Asquith (1999), USGS WRIR 99-4267.

    ARF = (mean depth over the watershed) / (point depth of the design storm).
    The factor depends on watershed size and shape and on the city whose
    precipitation network defined the depth-distance relation. Multiply a
    1-day, 2-year-or-greater point depth (e.g. NOAA Atlas 14) by the factor.

    Caution: derived from Austin, Dallas and Houston daily data only. The HDM
    states the method's applicability diminishes with distance from those
    cities and as the storm duration departs from 1 day. Duration other
    than 24 hr and recurrence interval below 2 yr always raise ``ValueError``
    (WRIR 99-4267 p. 25). Only the radius/area domain (0-50 mi) can be
    extrapolated, with ``extrapolate=True`` (a warning is logged).
